![Logo](./docs/k8stools.png)

The Kubernetes Management Tool is a powerful and user-friendly application built in NodeJS that simplifies the management and monitoring of Kubernetes clusters. With this tool, you can efficiently handle the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of your applications running on Kubernetes.

## Features

- **Cluster Management**: Easily connect to your Kubernetes clusters and manage them from a single interface. The tool supports multiple cluster configurations, allowing you to switch between clusters effortlessly.
  
- **Deployment**: Seamlessly deploy your applications to Kubernetes clusters with just a few clicks. The tool provides an intuitive interface for specifying deployment configurations, including container images, replica counts, resource limits, and more.

- **Scaling**: Scale your applications horizontally or vertically based on demand. The tool offers a straightforward way to adjust the number of replicas and allocate resources as needed.

- **Monitoring**: Gain insights into the health and performance of your Kubernetes applications through real-time monitoring. The tool integrates with popular monitoring solutions, such as Prometheus and Grafana, to provide comprehensive visibility into your cluster's metrics.

- **Logging**: Stream and analyze logs generated by your applications running on Kubernetes. The tool integrates with logging platforms like ELK Stack or Fluentd, allowing you to troubleshoot issues and gain deeper insights into your application's behavior.

- **Resource Management**: Efficiently manage Kubernetes resources, including pods, services, deployments, and more. The tool provides a simplified interface for creating, updating, and deleting resources, reducing the need for manual YAML editing.

- **Health Checks**: Perform health checks on your applications and receive alerts in case of failures. The tool supports defining custom health checks based on HTTP endpoints or specific metrics, ensuring the continuous availability of your applications.
